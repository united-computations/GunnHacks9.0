                <Question q="What is a hackathon?">
                    Hackathons are where your crazy idea becomes reality. Students work in teams of up to four for 24
                    hours to create something amazing. Build anything — there are no restrictions on what you can create.
                    Dive in and make the most incredible thing you can alongside fellow creators.

                <Question q="Who can attend?">
                    Any PAUSD student can attend GunnHacks. Unfortunately, we cannot allow college or out-of-district
                    students to attend this time around.

                <Question q="What if I don’t know how to code?">
                    All students regardless of coding ability or experience are welcome. Hackathons are a great place to
                    learn, so come and build your first app, website, or anything else! We’ll also have workshops
                    for you to start off or learn something new.

                <Question q="What can I build?">
                    Web, mobile, hardware, you name it — any type of project is welcome. Projects will be judged based
                    on creativity, technical difficulty, polish, and utility by a panel of industry judges.

                {/* Update with team formation event info when that becomes available */}
                <Question q="How big should teams be?">
                    We highly encourage you to build with a team. Teamwork is deeply rooted in the hacking ethos, and
                    you’ll have a better time building with your brightest peers. Teams should consist of no more
                    than four people.
                </Question>
                <Question q="What if I don’t have a team?">
                    No problem! Many hackers do not have a fully-formed team or hack concept before the event begins. We
                    will be hosting team-forming activities before hacking begins to help you find the perfect match. If
                    you’re a first-time hacker, there will be many others looking for team members with whom you can work.
                </Question>
                <Question q="How much does it cost?">
                    Participation in GunnHacks is completely free. However, due to the{/* online */} nature of the
                    event, we recommend ownership of a computer{/* and access to the internet */}.
                </Question>
                <Question q="Do I have to work the whole time?">
                    No, not at all! We will have fun activities and workshops you can participate in when
                    you want to take a break.
